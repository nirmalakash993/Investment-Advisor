Suggesting Best Companies to Invest

## Description

The Investment Advisor project is a highly sophisticated data analytics endeavor that empowers investors with data-driven insights for making informed investment decisions. By categorizing companies based on risk and suggesting top investment opportunities, this project provides a comprehensive solution for maximizing investment potential. Leveraging financial data, ratios, and market information, Investment Advisor aims to streamline the decision-making process and optimize investment outcomes.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection**: Acquired an extensive dataset comprising 500 companies listed on the esteemed Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). The dataset encompasses vital stock information, essential financial ratios, and detailed sector and industry classifications.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Employed meticulous data preprocessing techniques to ensure data integrity, consistency, and accuracy. This involved cleansing the dataset, addressing missing values, and validating data coherence to establish a robust foundation for subsequent analyses.

3. **Risk Categorization**:
   - Introduced a novel metric, "Delta," by calculating the percentage change between the current stock price and the 52-week high.
   - Applied rigorous conditions and stringent filters to categorize companies into four distinct risk categories: high risk-taking, moderate risk-taking, risk-taking, and low risk-taking.
   - Strategically sorted and meticulously selected the top five companies within each risk category based on the dividend per share, highlighting potential investment prospects.

4. **Income and Expense Analysis**:
   - Conducted comprehensive analysis on income and expense data derived from a representative individual.
   - Utilized this data to calculate the "money available for investment," a crucial indicator obtained by deducting net expenses from net income. This provides investors with a clear understanding of their available capital for potential investments.

5. **Investment Selection**:
   - Offered investors the flexibility to select a risk category from the four aforementioned options.
   - Based on the chosen risk category, the project seamlessly presented the top five companies for investment, aligning with the investor's risk profile.
